    "abstract": "PyTorch 2.x introduces a compiler designed to accelerate deep learning programs. However, for machine learning researchers, fully leveraging the PyTorch compiler can be challenging due to its operation at the Python bytecode level, making it appear as an opaque box. To address this, we introduce depyf, a tool designed to demystify the inner workings of the PyTorch compiler. depyf decompiles the bytecode generated by PyTorch back into equivalent source code and establishes connections between the code objects in the memory and their counterparts in source code format on the disk. This feature enables users to step through the source code line by line using debuggers, thus enhancing their understanding of the underlying processes. Notably, depyf is non-intrusive and user-friendly, primarily relying on two convenient context managers for its core functionality. The project is openly available at https://github.com/thuml/depyf and is recognized as a PyTorch ecosystem project at https://pytorch.org/blog/introducing-depyf.",
