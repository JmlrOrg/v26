    "abstract": "We study the deletion robust version of submodular maximization under matroid constraints. The goal is to extract a small-size summary of the data set that contains a high-value independent set even after an adversary deletes some elements. We present constant-factor approximation algorithms, whose space complexity depends on the rank $k$ of the matroid, the number $d$ of deleted elements, and the input precision $\\varepsilon$. In the centralized setting we present a $(4.494+O(\\varepsilon))$-approximation algorithm with summary size $O( \\frac{k+d}{\\varepsilon^2}\\log \\frac{k}{\\varepsilon})$ that improves to a $(3.582+O(\\varepsilon))$-approximation with $O(k + \\frac{d}{\\varepsilon^2}\\log \\frac{k}{\\varepsilon})$ summary size when the objective is monotone.  In the streaming setting we provide a $(9.294 + O(\\varepsilon))$-approximation algorithm with summary size and memory $O(k + \\frac{d}{\\varepsilon^2}\\log \\frac{k}{\\varepsilon})$; the approximation factor is then improved to  $(5.582+O(\\varepsilon))$ in the monotone case.",
