    "abstract": "In this work, we consider bilevel optimization when the lower-level problem is strongly convex. Recent works show that with a Hessian-vector product (HVP) oracle, one can provably find an $\\epsilon$-stationary point within ${O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ oracle calls. However, the HVP oracle may be inaccessible or expensive in practice. Kwon et al. (ICML 2023) addressed this issue by proposing a first-order method that can achieve the same goal at a slower rate of $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$.  In this paper, we incorporate a two-time-scale update to improve their method to achieve the near-optimal $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ first-order oracle complexity. Our analysis is highly extensible. In the stochastic setting, our algorithm can achieve the stochastic first-order oracle complexity of $\\tilde {O}(\\epsilon^{-4})$ and $\\tilde {O}(\\epsilon^{-6})$ when the stochastic noises are only in the  upper-level objective and in both level objectives, respectively.  When the objectives have higher-order smoothness conditions, our deterministic method can escape saddle points by injecting noise, and can be accelerated to  achieve a faster rate of $\\tilde {O}(\\epsilon^{-1.75})$ using Nesterov's momentum.",
